## consider:
- .tn propagation - which {c/sh)ould become a sandard set of fields
- confirmation(s) of liveStatus (pulseH) - check Netlify/projects
  - adding a TW/index.html file
    - expanding my use of:
      -  autoComplete - confirm this is working via re-tests
      -  dataDictionary instances both in the new site, and
      -  in localHost memory ( as a WPA ? )
    - autoUpdate this file ( whatever that meant )
- AnJ 3 QUs needs attention
  - neverAgain ; growthNeeds (competes ) ; newGuy ( just Chair )
    - try self-editing with GrimH
- colorWheel hotKey assigments
  - it should be possible for some of them to have OAUTH protection
    - this matters for HwWvW.com
      - GrimH instructions have been printed
        - localGitInstall is taking precedence 
- ...

### review newGuy (?) resume
confirm: hourly Rate?
- GIT capable
  - ...
- :interest
  - testing
    - written plans for assessment & agreement
      - this should be paid work

- try textBlaze alaiases for LaLo from CurbSide

- ...
  - support chores
    LOOM
      - Andrea Demo - ideally given by Lz as trainingByTutoring
  - Curbside demo - by eric
    - LaLo role
    - report designs via CurbSide
      - UlcLrc
      - centre of 3n X 3m
      - ...
### UniCode

- review this to see if it can be discarded
  - it should not be much work and recreating based on new knowledge will likely yield a better solution
- https://symbl.cc/en/search/?q=tail
- 0519: testing
  - NetliFy integration
    - suggestions are resulting from my perceived techStack
